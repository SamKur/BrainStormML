## Midnight ML Project by Susamay

I'm making this project as per latest pip standard by removing requirements.txt and installing dependecies via `pyproject.toml` file.
Its possible to install your package in editable mode using the following command (instead of -e . line present at last of requirements file and old `pip install -r requirements.txt` and `setup.py` file): 
`pip install -e .`
